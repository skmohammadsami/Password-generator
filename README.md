# Password-generator
The code has two functions:

generate_password(length): It makes a random password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The length of the password is decided by the user.
main(): It's where the program starts. It asks the user for the length of the password. If the length is okay (not zero or negative), it creates the password and shows it. If the length is not okay, it stops the program.
The program starts running from the main() function only if it's directly run, not if it's imported into another program.

The password made by generate_password() is random and strong because it's a mix of different characters and the length is decided by the user.

The user can easily input the length they want, and the generated password is shown on the screen.

In simple words, this code makes str
